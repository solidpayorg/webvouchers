    <i><b>A cabability URN for one time payments on the Internet</b></i>.
    <p>
      The concept of Web Vouchers introduces a standardized method for encoding and redeeming vouchers, voucher codes, 
      or bearer tokens within Uniform Resource Names (URNs) for one-time payments and services on the Internet. This 
      innovative approach aims to simplify and secure transactions across various online platforms, providing a universal 
      solution for one-time codes that offer a wide range of applications from e-commerce discounts to secure access tokens 
      for online services. By leveraging the existing infrastructure of URNs, Web Vouchers facilitate a seamless integration 
      into current web ecosystems, offering a unique blend of versatility, security, and ease of use not found in existing systems.

      <p>
        Web Vouchers are a new type of identifier for, voucher codes, bearer strings, or one time payments on the web. 
        
        
        These new identifiers are designed to enable the recipient to prove access to the funds associated with that voucher 
        with one or more entities that accept that voucher. 
        
        Web Vouchers are URNs of the form `urn:voucher:namespace:123456789abcdefghi`.
      </p>

        This document specifies a format, and operations that Web Vouchers may support.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>One time codes are a popular way of solving one off problems on the web. And example might be sending someone a
      code
      to log in to a system, or one to reset a password or one to creating a private address for a calendar. However
      there
      exists no generic URN on the web to encode such a one time code such that it can be used for redeeming a payment,
      good or service.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document specifies a format, and operations that Web Vouchers may support.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      This spec is a work in progress.

      The web vouchers spec started, and is currently being discussed, on the following <a

        Design Goals

      <p>
        Web Vouchers are a component of larger systems, such as
        the Linked Data ecosystem [[LINKED-DATA]], which have driven
        the design goals for this specification. This section summarizes the
        primary design goals for this specification.

      <h2>Design Considerations</h2>

      <p>There is often a public component, this is to allow the person owning/selling the voucher to know the
        voucher still contains value. The private part is what is used to redeem and claim the voucher credit. The
        private part is typically a one way retrieval process, e.g. tearing open the packet, scratching off the silver or
        a hologram.</p>

      <p>The the issuer, or mint, is often included in the URN. This is because you may have Starbucks, PayPal, CoinMode,
        Google, etc... could be issuing these vouchers. Whoever is issuing the voucher needs to be named somehow.</p>

      <p>Thirdley the currency needs to be described. This is either USD, BTC, GBP, starbuck points etc..</p>

      <p></p>Finally there is an optional expiry date option as many vouchers are handled
      by
      businesses who need to reclaim lost funds somehow and expiry solves this.</p>


      i.e. common fields could be

      <pre>
    voucher: to define it is some sort of voucher
    url: where to query and get more info about the voucher.
    public: very large integer value to verify amount voucher can be redeemed for.
    private: the redeeming number
    destination: platform specific could be a cryptoaddress or user handle
  </pre>


      This gives two urns. One to check a voucher and another to redeem it

      <h4>JSON key values</h4>

      The following are suggested JSON fields to tie to a voucher.

      <pre>
      {
        issuer:"acme",
        public: 12345678901234567890,
        is_valid: true,
        currency: "bitcoin",
        amount:1000000
        expires: 1238972934 (epoch time)
        redeem_url : "https://www.acme.com/redeem"
        remaining_uses : 1
        redeemed : false
        redeemed_by : "??"
        redeemed_dates : [ 123987234, 124789238 ]
      }</pre>

    <h3>URN Format</h3>

    Each namespace will have its own format and a link to the documentation.  Current namespaces are `txo` (transaction object), `cashu` <a href="https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/00.md">cashu nuts</a>, and `web` generic web vouchers
    
    The basic idea is to create a capability URN (like a capability URI but with an URN) and allow it to be used as a
    voucher for spending. The proposed format is :

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple example a Web Voucher">
      urn:voucher:cashu: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
    </pre>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple example a Web Voucher">
      urn:voucher:txo:chain:123456789abcdef:vout?key=K
    </pre>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple example a Web Voucher">
      urn:voucher:web:123456789abcdefghi
    </pre>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Discovery</h3>

    There are two things that are useful to discover. Firstly, more information about a
    voucher. The discovered document SHOULD return Linked Data. This can be done on a well known url, for example :

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Well Known Discovery for a Web Voucher">
      https://webvouchers.org/.well-known/voucher/123456789abcdefghi
          </pre>

    The other convenient thing that can be discovered is a server or servers that accept the voucher. This could be done
    over a gossip network with an initial bootstrap. A discovery node accepts the URN and points to a document with
    relevant servers.

    <h3>Implementations</h3>

    <h4>Client</h4>

    The first client implementation uses vouchers to interact with the lightning network.<br /><br />

    <h4>Server</h4>
