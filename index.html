    <i><b>Web Vouchers: A Simple and Secure Way to Handle One-Time Payments on the Web.</b></i>.
    <p>
    Web Vouchers introduce a simple, standardized way to use vouchers, codes, or tokens for one-time 
    payments and services on the web. By using Uniform Resource Names (URNs), Web Vouchers easily 
    integrate into existing web systems, offering a secure and interoperable solution that improves upon 
    current methods.
    </p>

    <p>
    Designed as urn:voucher:namespace:123456789abcdefghi, these vouchers can be used for everything 
    from e-commerce discounts to secure access for web services. This spec explains how to format 
    and use Web Vouchers, provides examples, and addresses important aspects like security, making sure 
    transactions are safe, and extensible, ensuring everyone can use them easily. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
    We've included guidelines for developers on how to implement Web Vouchers, along with tools to check 
    if they're set up correctly. Plus, there's information on how to give feedback and help improve future 
    versions of the spec.
    </p>

    <p>
    In short, Web Vouchers aim to make web payments and services simpler and safer for everyone, everywhere.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>One time codes are a popular way of solving one off problems on the web. And example might be sending someone a
      code
      to log in to a system, or one to reset a password or one to creating a private address for a calendar. However
      there
      exists no generic URN on the web to encode such a one time code such that it can be used for redeeming a payment,
      good or service.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document specifies a format, and operations that Web Vouchers may support.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      This spec is a work in progress.

      This document in an informal draft originally discussed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/">w3c web
      payments community group</a>, now inactive.  It has been updated to take into account new innovations such as electronic
      coins such as bitcoin, the lightning network, and Cashu.

        Web Vouchers are a component of larger systems, such as
        the Linked Data ecosystem [[LINKED-DATA]], which have driven
        the design goals for this specification. This section summarizes the

      <h2>Design Considerations</h2>

      <p>There is often a public component, this is to allow the person owning/selling the voucher to know the
        voucher still contains value. The private part is what is used to redeem and claim the voucher credit. The
        private part is typically a one way retrieval process, e.g. tearing open the packet, scratching off the silver or
        a hologram.</p>

      <p>The the issuer, or mint, is often included in the URN. This is because you may have Starbucks, PayPal, CoinMode,
        Google, etc... could be issuing these vouchers. Whoever is issuing the voucher needs to be named somehow.</p>

      <p>Thirdley the currency needs to be described. This is either USD, BTC, GBP, starbuck points etc..</p>

      <p></p>Finally there is an optional expiry date option as many vouchers are handled
      by
      businesses who need to reclaim lost funds somehow and expiry solves this.</p>


      i.e. common fields could be

      <pre>
    voucher: to define it is some sort of voucher
    url: where to query and get more info about the voucher.
    public: very large integer value to verify amount voucher can be redeemed for.
    private: the redeeming number
    destination: platform specific could be a cryptoaddress or user handle
  </pre>


      This gives two urns. One to check a voucher and another to redeem it

      <h4>JSON key values</h4>

      The following are suggested JSON fields to tie to a voucher.

      <pre>
      {
        issuer:"acme",
        public: 12345678901234567890,
        is_valid: true,
        currency: "bitcoin",
        amount:1000000
        expires: 1238972934 (epoch time)
        redeem_url : "https://www.acme.com/redeem"
        remaining_uses : 1
        redeemed : false
        redeemed_by : "??"
        redeemed_dates : [ 123987234, 124789238 ]
      }</pre>

  <h2>Understanding Namespaces in Web Vouchers</h2>
  <p>
    In the context of Web Vouchers, namespaces play a crucial role in organizing and identifying vouchers across various domains and applications. 
    A namespace is a part of the voucher's URN that specifies its category or issuer, enabling a structured and hierarchical approach to voucher 
    management. This system facilitates the differentiation between vouchers, even when they originate from different entities or serve distinct purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the URN <code>urn:voucher:cashu:123456789abcdefghi</code> uses "cashu" as its namespace, indicating a voucher associated with the Cashu project. 
    Similarly, a voucher intended for general web use might employ a namespace like "web", as in <code>urn:voucher:web:123456789abcdefghi</code>. 
    The Web namespace is generic web based voucher issuance, JSON will safely encode small JSON objects, txo will be used by selectronic coins, and so on.
    By utilizing namespaces, the Web Vouchers system ensures interoperability and clarity, allowing vouchers to be easily categorized, discovered, and validated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The design of Web Vouchers supports a wide range of namespaces, accommodating everything from corporate issuers to cryptocurrencies, and from loyalty points 
    to fiat currencies. This flexibility ensures that Web Vouchers can adapt to various use cases and evolve alongside the web's ever-changing landscape.
  </p>

    <h3>URN Format</h3>

    Each namespace will have its own format and a link to the documentation.  Current namespaces are `txo` (transaction object), `cashu` <a href="https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/00.md">cashu nuts</a>, and `web` generic web vouchers
    
    The basic idea is to create a capability URN (like a capability URI but with an URN) and allow it to be used as a
    voucher for spending. The proposed format is :

    <section>
      <h3>Cashu</h3>

      <a href="https://cashu.space/">Cashu</a>a is a free and open-source Chaumian ecash system built for Bitcoin. Cashu offers near-perfect privacy for users of custodial Bitcoin applications. 
      Nobody needs to know who you are, how much funds you have, and who you transact with.  The format is `cashu` then `A` which is the version followed by
      URL safe base64 encoded JSON.

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple example a Web Voucher">
      urn:voucher:cashu: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

    </section>

    

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple example a Web Voucher">
      urn:voucher:txo:chain:123456789abcdef:vout?key=K
    </pre>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple example a Web Voucher">
      urn:voucher:web:123456789abcdefghi
    </pre>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Discovery</h3>

    There are two things that are useful to discover. Firstly, more information about a
    voucher. The discovered document SHOULD return Linked Data. This can be done on a well known url, for example :

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Well Known Discovery for a Web Voucher">
      https://webvouchers.org/.well-known/voucher/cashu/123456789abcdefghi
          </pre>

    The other convenient thing that can be discovered is a server or servers that accept the voucher. This could be done
    over a gossip network with an initial bootstrap. A discovery node accepts the URN and points to a document with
    relevant servers.

    <h3>Implementations</h3>

    <h4>Client</h4>

    The first client implementation uses vouchers to interact with the lightning network.<br /><br />

    <h4>Server</h4>
